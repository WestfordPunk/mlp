# Multi-Layer Perceptron Library

MLP is a multi-layer perceptron library. It is designed in C++, and will facilitate the creation and optimization of multi-layer neural networks ( perceptrons).

# Example of use

  int layers2[] = {1,5,1};
  MultiLayerPerceptron mlp2(3,layers2);
  mlp2.Run("sin.dat",500);
